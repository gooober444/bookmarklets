# Collection of bookmarklets

## Introduction
I either maintain or find these bookmarklets.
There aren't a lot and they aren't very complicated because beyond a certain point a complex userscript, website or extension would do a better job.
I suck at Javascript and generally cobble these together on a needs-basis, so feel free to open a pull request. Readability and grokability is at a premium though.

## Loader
The general bookmarklet that loads scripts is
`javascript:void(function(){var myScript=document.createElement('script');myScript.type='text/javascript';myScript.src='https://myuser.github.io/myrepo/customscript.js?t='+Math.random();document.body.appendChild(myScript);})();`
with `customscript.js` being replaced with whatever script you want to load. `Math.random` for cache busting.

## Scripts
Following URLs are the above loader with the respective script URL already inserted.
Make a new bookmark, name it whatever you want to trigger it with and then copy any one of the URLs into the URL part.
